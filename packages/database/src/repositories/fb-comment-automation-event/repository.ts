/**
 * Deletes FAILED `FBCommentAutomationEvent` rows older than the retention
 * window, oldest first, in chunks so a long delete never blocks the
 * comment-automation loop writing a new event.
 *
 * `status = 'failed'` is part of the where-clause, not an implementation
 * detail: successful rows are the analytics page's whole history and are kept
 * forever, while a failure is only ever read by the Error Logs panel, which
 * mirrors `ErrorLog`'s 30-day window. Deleting a failed row does NOT disturb
 * the lifetime counters on `FBCommentAutomation` — they are stored columns, not
 * an aggregate over this table.
 *
 * `FBCommentAutomationEvent_failed_createdAt_idx` is the partial index this
 * scan rides; without it the oldest-first select would walk an ever-growing
 * prefix of kept successful rows on every run.
 *
 * `stopReason` tells the caller whether the backlog drained — repeated
 * non-`drained` runs mean failures accumulate faster than retention clears them.
