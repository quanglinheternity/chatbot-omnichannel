/**
 * Why an automation declined to answer a comment it was shown.
 *
 * One value per `continue` in `processCommentAutomation`'s filter chain, in the
 * order the loop evaluates them. This is the whole vocabulary of the Misses
 * column: a comment that passed every gate and then failed to send is NOT a
 * miss — it is an attempt, and it earns a `failed` `FBCommentAutomationEvent`
 * row instead (see that partial's docblock for the filtered-out vs.
 * blocked-delivery line).
 *
 * Adding a filter to the loop means adding a value here AND recording it next
 * to the filter's `logAutomationSkipped` call, or the new filter silently
 * swallows comments the Misses column never accounts for.
