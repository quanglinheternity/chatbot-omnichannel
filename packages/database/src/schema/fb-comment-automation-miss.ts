/**
 * Append-only log of comments an automation was shown and declined to answer —
 * the Misses column and the drill-down behind it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `FBCommentAutomationEvent`. Three reasons:
 *
 * - That table is unique on `(automationId, commentId, replyChannel)` and its
 *   `replyChannel`/`replyType` are `NOT NULL`; a miss has neither, because no
 *   branch was ever chosen.
 * - Every analytics-page query (the replies series, the user-comment and
 *   bot-reply panels, Error Logs) aggregates that table directly. Mixing a row
 *   type none of them want in would mean auditing all of them forever after.
 * - Volume. `findActiveAutomations` scopes by workspace + channel, not by post,
 *   so one comment is shown to EVERY active automation of that channel and
 *   misses outnumber replies by however many automations the workspace runs.
 *   Keeping them out of the analytics table is what keeps that table fast.
 *
 * **These rows are never purged.** `FBCommentAutomationEvent`'s failed rows
 * have a 30-day window; misses are kept for the life of the automation by an
 * explicit product decision, so the drill-down can always explain the counter.
 * If that ever has to change, `purgeFailedCommentAutomationEvents` is the
 * pattern to copy — and it needs its own partial index, the way that one does.
 *
 * One row per `(automationId, commentId)`: an automation sees a given comment
 * once and declines it for exactly one reason (the first gate that rejects it).
 * The unique index makes a BullMQ retry or a redelivered webhook idempotent via
 * `onConflictDoNothing`, which is what keeps `FBCommentAutomation.missedCount`
 * exact — the counter moves per row actually returned, never per call.
