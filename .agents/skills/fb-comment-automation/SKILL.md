## Data-flow in one line

`feed webhook (verb "add") / instagram comments webhook → incomingComment → receiveComment → processCommentAutomation → (AIAgent) commentAIReply`.

## The traps (read before editing)

1. **`parent_id` is ALWAYS present, but it does NOT always equal `post_id` on a top-level
   comment.** A truthy `parentId` does not mean "reply", and neither does
   `parentId !== postId` — Facebook varies the composite per post type. A reel sends
   `parent_id` byte-identical to `post_id`; a **photo post sends `{albumId}_{storyId}`**,
   where only the trailing story id agrees. Use
   `isCommentReply(parentId, postId, commentId)`, which compares the **trailing** ids via
   `normalizePostId`. Testing the raw strings + default `ignoreCommentReplies: true`
   silently drops every top-level comment on a photo post. A reply is still safe to spot
   because `comment_id` stays anchored to the story (`{storyId}_{replyId}`) even for a
   reply, so it can never collide with its own `parent_id`'s trailing half.

2. **Post ids are composite `{pageId}_{storyId}`**; the picker stores 3 different formats
   (published/ads composite, reels bare id, manual free-text). Always compare through
   `normalizePostId` (trailing story id). Never `post.value.includes(rawPostId)`.

3. **Every skip must log AND record a miss.** The loop uses
   `logAutomationSkipped(..., reason)` before each `continue`, immediately followed by
   `collectMiss(automation.id, <reason>)`. `processCommentAutomation` returns `void` →
   BullMQ always logs `returnValue: null`, so a skip with no log is undebuggable in
   production; and a skip with no `collectMiss` is a filter whose declines the **Misses**
   column silently never counts — no compile error, the number is just quietly too low. A
   new filter therefore needs three things landed together: the guard, a new value in
   `commentAutomationMissReasons`
   (`packages/database/src/partials/fb-comment-automation-miss.ts`, which needs a migration
   for the pgEnum), and a case in the `gateCases` table in
   `apps/worker/__tests__/comment-automation.test.ts`. Misses go to their OWN table
   (`FBCommentAutomationMiss`), never `FBCommentAutomationEvent` — see trap 16.

4. **AIAgent reply ≠ DM auto-responder.** `publicReply`/`privateReply` of type `AIAgent`
   store the **selected agent id** in `value`. Generation uses `generateAIReplyText`
   (tools + rich OFF, returns text only); the comment handler routes public → public
   comment reply (`type:"comment"` + `replyToCommentId`), private → DM. Do NOT route
   through `processAutomatedResponse` — it uses the workspace *default* agent and always
   sends a DM.

5. **Dedup ledger is dual-purpose.** `fbCommentAutomationReplyModel` rows
   (`automationId, contactId, postId`) are written after every successful reply and read by
   both `replyOncePerUserPerPost` (same post) and `replyToUsersWhoCommentedOnOtherPosts`
   (other post). The unique index `FBCommentAutomationReply_dedup_idx` already serves
   `(automationId, contactId)` + `postId != ?` queries — no new index needed; use a
   `LIMIT 1` existence check, not `$count`.

6. **Three channels, one loop.** `type` is `messenger` | `instagram` (Instagram Login) |
   `instagramFacebook` (Instagram via Facebook Login) — see
   `CommentAutomationChannelType` — and `findActiveAutomations` filters on it, so every
   capability must be routed per channel. Private DM text works on all three via
   `PRIVATE_REPLY_TEXT_SENDERS` (comment_id-anchored Send API); comment liking exists
   only on `messenger` + `instagramFacebook` (Instagram Login's `likeComment` is a logged
   no-op); the attachment lookup behind `hideComments.hasImage`/`hasVideo` is
   messenger-only. Hide an unsupported toggle in the builder form instead of shipping a
   dead switch.

7. **A `private` flow reply runs on the DM conversation; a `public` one does not.** The
   comment conversation is anchored to the post (`sourceId = postId`), but DM replies land
   on the DM conversation (`sourceId IS NULL`). Enqueue `sendFlow` with the comment
   conversation and the flow parks where no reply can reach it — first message delivers,
   then the flow stalls at its first waiting step with **no error anywhere** (no throw, no
   queue error, no `sendError`; `resolveIncomingTextRouting` just finds no challenge and
   falls through to `automatedResponse`). Private uses
   `resolveDirectMessageConversationId`; public deliberately keeps `ctx.conversationId`,
   because the contact's next comment resolves back to that same conversation. Never
   "unify" the two branches. `commentAnchor` is orthogonal — it decides *delivery*: a
   `private` anchor is one-shot (Meta allows one comment_id-anchored DM per comment, so the
   first message-producing step claims it), a `public` one is never consumed and every step
   of the run posts as a comment reply. A claimed private anchor is **not dropped** — it
   rides on as `spent: true` so each channel's `sendFlowStep` can tell a comment-triggered
   follow-up from a plain flow message and gate it on `contact.lastIncomingMessageAt` via
   `assertCommentPrivateReplyFollowUpDeliverable` (`@chatbotx.io/sdk`): inside the 24h
   window it sends as a normal DM, outside it throws
   `comment_private_reply_already_used` → visible `sendError`. Never "restore" the drop;
   that turns the failure back into a Send API rejection swallowed by `sendFlowStep`.

8. **`options.trackUserTags` is the one option that is not a filter, and the two channels
   resolve it by completely different mechanisms.** It never skips — it stamps
   `totalTagged`/`totalNewTagged` onto the comment message's `contentAttributes`, which is
   where `{{total_tagged}}`/`{{total_new_tagged}}` read them from via `getLastUserComment`
   (the same path as `{{last_post_id}}`, so both are **last-comment scoped, not lifetime
   totals**, and the write must stay `await`ed *before* the reply dispatches or the first
   comment renders an empty value and only a retry looks right). Facebook gets real user
   ids from the webhook's `message_tags` (Graph fallback when absent) and matches
   `ContactInbox.sourceId`; **Instagram has no tagged-user data at all** — no webhook
   field, no `message_tags` on the IG Comment node — so it regexes `@handle` out of the
   text and matches `ContactInbox.sourceUsername`. Don't "fix" the IG branch by looking
   for a structured field; it does not exist (verified against production payloads). An
   absent key resolving to `null` rather than `0` is deliberate: a flow must be able to
   tell "nobody was tagged" from "this automation never tracked". See `comment-tags.ts`
   and the docs' Tag tracking section for the two IG accuracy caveats.

9. **Instagram comment replies carry text only.** `POST /{ig-comment-id}/replies` has no
   `attachment_url` — that is Facebook-Page-only (`integrations/messenger`). Both Instagram
   variants' `sendComment` throw `ChannelError(PAYLOAD_INVALID)` when the message has
   attachments, so a media step of a public reply flow surfaces a `sendError` in the inbox
   instead of disappearing behind a `logger.warn`. Never "fix" that back into an empty
   `{ messageIds: [] }` return.

10. **Instagram-via-Facebook private replies use the Page node, not the IG node.**
    `sendPrivateReplyMessage` (`integrations/instagram-facebook/src/apis/comment.ts`) must
    post to `/{pageId}/messages`. `/{igId}/messages` returns `(#3) Application does not
    have the capability to make this API call.` even with `instagram_manage_messages`,
    `pages_messaging` and Human Agent at Advanced Access — code 3 means "this edge does
    not exist on this node", so it is NOT an App-dashboard problem. Already regressed
    twice (#875 fixed it, #945 reverted it to green a stale test whose fixture had no
    `pageId`, making the URL `/undefined/messages`). It breaks every private reply on the
    channel: `text`, `AIAgent`, a `flow` reply's first message, and the agent's manual
    inbox private reply (which enters via `handlers/comment/outgoing-private-reply`, not
    the automation loop). Instagram Login is different on purpose — `me/messages` on
    `graph.instagram.com`. Keep the `send-private-reply.test.ts` guard that asserts the IG
    node is never called. Also note both Instagram packages log
    `module=integration-instagram`, so attribute production failures by request host, not
    module name.

11. **The list columns read counters, the dialog reads events — never swap them.** The
    Sent/Delivered/Seen/Clicked/Failed columns come from lifetime `*Count` columns on
    `FBCommentAutomation`, NOT from aggregating `FBCommentAutomationEvent` the way
    broadcast aggregates `ContactOnBroadcast`: a nightly cron purges the FAILED event rows
    after `COMMENT_AUTOMATION_ERROR_RETENTION_DAYS` (successful rows are kept for the life
    of the automation), so an aggregate would shrink `failedCount` every night. What
    keeps the counters exact is that every increment counts the rows a conditional
    `UPDATE ... WHERE "<col>At" IS NULL RETURNING "automationId"` actually returned — a
    redelivered webhook or a BullMQ retry returns nothing and moves nothing. If you add
    an outcome, add BOTH the timestamp column (for the drill-down and the guard) and the
    counter, and drive the counter off the returned rows. Never increment on a call count.

12. **A multi-step `flow` reply is ONE reply — its steps can settle in either order.**
    `sendFlowStep` swallows a step's error and runs the next one, so one event row can
    take several outcomes. Any step through means delivered and NOT failed, whichever way
    round they land: `settleEvent` refuses to fail an already-delivered row, and
    `markDelivered` clears an earlier `failedAt` and reports `clearedFailure` so the
    service takes `failedCount` back down. Only every step failing counts as a failure.
    Remove either half and a 3-step reply reports delivered + failed for the same reply,
    pushing the column percentages (measured against attempts) past 100%.

13. **Two independent button-payload encoders — patching the worker's is NOT enough.**
    `convertButtonsToTemplate` (`apps/worker/src/chat/handlers/send-flow-step.ts`) only writes
    the `Message` row's `contentAttributes`. The payload the contact actually TAPS is encoded
    again by each channel, because `sendFlowStep` hands the integration the raw step. Grep
    `encodeButtonPayload` under `integrations/{messenger,instagram,instagram-facebook}/src`
    and mirror EVERY hit on a flow-send path — messenger alone has three
    (`send-button.ts`, `send-quick-reply.ts`, `send-messenger-template.ts`), and
    `send-carousel.ts` only looks absent because it shares `getButtonTemplate`. The two hits
    that are correctly excluded are `messenger-ads-json.ts` and `lib/persistent-menu.ts`,
    neither of which sends a flow reply. Attribution added to only one side compiles, passes
    the worker tests, renders correctly in the inbox — and the click still reports nothing.
    The carrier is **`metadata`** (`COMMENT_AUTOMATION_PAYLOAD_TYPE`, read with
    `extractMetadata("commentAutomationId", metadata)`), never `CommentAnchor.automationId`:
    the anchor never reaches the encoders, is withheld from `instagramFacebook` and from
    non-message steps, and is lost across a Wait, while `metadata` survives all three
    (`ContactOnSmartDelay.metadata` is a real column). Node-level quick replies are the one
    exception — they already ship the canonical postback via `getCanonicalReplyPayload`.
    The guard tests are `integrations/*/__tests__/comment-automation-button-payload.test.ts`.

14. **Delivery is settled at each send site, not on the event bus.** There are four, and a
    new reply type needs whichever apply: `send-message.ts` (public text/AI, via the
    `contentAttributes.commentAutomation` anchor), `send-flow-step.ts` (both flow
    branches, same anchor), `executePrivateReply` and `processCommentAIReply` (private,
    sent inline through the Send API and leaving no `Message` row for a webhook to match).
    Only **Seen** and **Clicked** ride the bus, because only they arrive later and name
    something other than the reply. A `flow` reply carries its automation in
    `CommentAnchor.automationId` — that is also what puts the id into
    `encodeButtonPayload`'s 7th field so clicks can be attributed at all.

15. **Retention is per OUTCOME, and the analytics date filter is unbounded because of it.**
    `purgeFailedCommentAutomationEvents` deletes `status = 'failed'` rows only, after
    `COMMENT_AUTOMATION_ERROR_RETENTION_DAYS`; a successful row lives as long as the
    automation, which is what lets the filter offer `lifeTime`. Two things follow. (a) A
    new query that must survive the purge cannot read failed rows — and any new purge
    predicate needs its own partial index, the way
    `FBCommentAutomationEvent_failed_createdAt_idx` keeps the oldest-first chunk scan off
    the kept rows. (b) An unbounded range means the replies series is bucketed by MONTH
    past 60 days: the query and the zero-fill both take the width from
    `resolveRangeGranularity`, so changing one without the other yields one real point
    followed by a run of zeroes. Monthly keys stay `YYYY-MM-01` so the client parses them
    like daily ones — and the client parses a `YYYY-MM-DD` key as a LOCAL day (the server
    already resolved it in the viewer's timezone); `new Date(key)` reads it as UTC midnight
    and renders the previous month west of Greenwich.

14. **A `text` public reply is a LIST, and it is still ONE reply.** `publicReply.values` holds up
    to `FB_COMMENT_REPLY_MAX_TEXTS` messages, each posted as its own comment reply. Never read
    `reply.value` directly — `resolveReplyTexts` is the only thing that knows the fallback to the
    legacy single-string shape, and `willSendReply` reads through it too; disagreeing there makes
    an automation go silent with no skip log. Write through `normalizeReplyTexts` so `value` and
    `values` cannot drift (a caller PATCHing only `value` on a row that has `values` is otherwise
    ignored without a word). Bookkeeping treats the set as ONE reply — one analytics event,
    `repliesCount` +1 — because `FBCommentAutomationEvent` is unique on
    `(automationId, commentId, replyChannel)` and every settle helper names a row by that triple.
    Sends are staggered by `PUBLIC_REPLY_SPACING_MS`; equal delays let the chat queue's
    `concurrency: 5` reorder them under the comment. Private reply stays single-message on
    purpose. In the form, the editor rows MUST be keyed by `field.id` — see trap 15.

15. **`TiptapEditorField` inside a `useFieldArray` must be keyed by `field.id`.** It snapshots its
    content once in a `useEffect` keyed on the form path. Removing an entry shifts the later ones
    but leaves the path at a given position unchanged, so an index key shows the removed entry's
    text — no error, just wrong content saved over the user's. See
    `features/shared/comment-automation/reply-texts-field.tsx`.

16. **A declined comment goes to `FBCommentAutomationMiss`, never to the event table.**
    `FBCommentAutomationEvent` only ever holds work the automation *attempted*: it is unique
    on `(automationId, commentId, replyChannel)` with `replyChannel`/`replyType` `NOT NULL`,
    and a decline has neither; every analytics-page query aggregates it directly, so a row
    type none of them want would have to be excluded from each one forever; and misses
    outnumber replies by however many automations the workspace runs
    (`findActiveAutomations` scopes by workspace + channel, **not** by post, so ONE comment
    is shown to every active automation on the channel). Three consequences. (a) The whole
    run's declines are flushed in **one** `recordMisses` call after the loop — never one
    insert per automation, or a busy Page fires N statements per comment. (b) `missedCount`
    is driven off the rows `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING` actually returned,
    exactly like the delivery counters, so a retry counts nothing. (c) These rows are
    **never purged**, by product decision — do not add a retention cron without asking, and
    if one is ever added it needs its own partial index the way
    `FBCommentAutomationEvent_failed_createdAt_idx` does. The percentage on the column
    divides by `repliesCount + missedCount`, NOT `sentCount`: a decline is not an attempt,
    and `sentCount` counts private DMs only. A blocked private reply stays a `failed`
    event — it was attempted.

## Adding a new filter option (recipe)

1. Add the field to `fbCommentOptionsSchema` (partials) + DB default in the schema file
   (`jsonb` default string).
2. If it needs a DB lookup, add a method to `fbCommentAutomationService` (reuse the dedup
   table + its index where possible; prefer `LIMIT 1` existence checks).
3. Add the guard inside the loop in `processCommentAutomation`, **with a
   `logAutomationSkipped(..., reason)` AND a `collectMiss(automation.id, <reason>)` before
   `continue`** — plus the new value in `commentAutomationMissReasons` (pgEnum → migration).
4. Surface the toggle in `apps/builder/src/features/fb-comments/components/fb-comment-form.tsx`
   and add i18n keys to **every** locale file in `apps/builder/messages/` (the i18n parity
   check in `pnpm lint` fails on a missing key in any of the 20 locales).
5. Extend `apps/worker/__tests__/comment-automation.test.ts` — including a row in the
   `gateCases` table under `describe("processCommentAutomation misses")`.

## Adding a new reply type (recipe)

1. Extend `fbCommentReplyTypes` (partials) — `fbCommentReplySchema.type` and the
   `commentAutomationReplyType` pgEnum on `FBCommentAutomationEvent` both derive from it,
   so a new value needs a database migration too.
2. Handle it in BOTH `executePublicReply` (`public-reply.ts`) and `executePrivateReply`
   (`private-reply.ts`). Public = message `type:"comment"` + `replyToCommentId` via
   `sendChannelMessage`; private = the channel's entry in `PRIVATE_REPLY_TEXT_SENDERS`, so
   a new type has to work for all three channels (messenger, instagram,
   instagramFacebook).
3. Update `willSendReply` so dedup/`repliesCount` only count when a reply is actually
   dispatchable (e.g. require `value`).
4. Return a `CommentReplyOutcome` (`reply-outcome.ts`) with the text the customer will
   actually see — that is what the analytics "Bot replies to comments" table groups on.
   Returning `null` still means "declined to send", exactly as the old boolean `false` did.
5. If it needs async work (like AIAgent), add a dedicated job in worker-config, a handler,
   and a `case` in `apps/worker/src/integration/worker.ts` (the `never` exhaustiveness
   guard forces this — type + dispatch + handler land together).

9. **An async reply type records its analytics event in TWO places.** `text` and `flow`
   are settled by the dispatcher in `index.ts` the moment they return an outcome, but
   `AIAgent` cannot be — its text does not exist yet. So `executePublicReply` /
   `executePrivateReply` open the row with `replyText: null`, and
   `processCommentAIReply` (`ai-reply.ts`) calls
   `commentAutomationAnalyticsService.settleEvent` to land the generated text, or a
   `failed` row carrying the bail-out reason. Every `rollbackCommentDedup` in that file is
   paired with a settle via `abandonAIReply` — miss one and the analytics page reports a
   silent non-reply as a success. Any new async reply type has to do the same on both
   sides.

## Verify

```bash
pnpm --filter worker vitest run __tests__/comment-automation.test.ts
pnpm --filter worker check-types
pnpm lint
```

Production sanity after deploy: comment on (a) a normal post, (b) a reel, (c) a comment
with a bare-domain link + hide-link on, (d) an automation with reply = AI Agent — and
confirm each fires or logs a clear skip reason.
